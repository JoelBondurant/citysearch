1) Download and parse the data set, hosted here:

	http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/cities1000.zip

	For further reference on what all that information actually means, check out the expanded
	description in the readme: http://download.geonames.org/export/dump

2) Build out an API that showcases the following functionality:
* Proximity Query
	* Given a City identifier X query for the k closest cities where closeness is
	measured using an appropriately chosen measure of distance by latitude and
	longitude.
	* Support restricting the above query by country.
* Lexical Query
	* Given an input word, return any cities that match contain that word
	* Support multiple words, treating each one independently (e.g. The query
	"taco bell" would be treated as "taco" AND "bell")
